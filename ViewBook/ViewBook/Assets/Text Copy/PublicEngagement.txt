Emily Carr is actively engaged with the public through many different touch points on and off campus. Our collaborations with the larger community, industry, and other institutions throughout British Columbia underpin Emily Carr’s academic framework and are woven into our innovative curriculum through the Faculty of Culture + Community.


The Faculty of Culture and Community is unique to Emily Carr and is concerned with social responsibility, community engagement, cultural diversity, service and sustainability in both non-profit and industry sectors. The Faculty promotes and supports an innovative cross-disciplinary curriculum. Students are given the opportunity to interact and create relevant work that serves the community. Recent projects include collaborations with:  Elections BC – Designing For Democracy, Natural Capital with the David Suzuki Foundation, the Vancouver Downtown Business Improvement Association WRAP project, as well as our ongoing partnership with British Columbia Rapid Transit Commission, where student work is showcased in transit spaces across Metro Vancouver.
