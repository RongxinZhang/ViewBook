The Master of Applied Arts (MAA) degree promotes critical reflection and intellectual inquiry, and links art and media to professional practices and industry. You will have the opportunity to combine theory, research and studio practice with practical experience.Available through residency and low residency delivery options, you will be immersed in courses focused in research, theory and studio practice. Seminars offer a constructive environment for discourse and critique, while a series of lectures and studio visits from renowned artists informs and supplements the further development of your practice. Naturally interdisciplinary, you will have access to both traditional and state-of-the- art technologies through Emily Carr’s Intersections Digital Studios.  Collaborate with students and professionals to explore the Motion Capture Studio for research in animation, ergonomics, and interactive entertainment, a CNC machine for cutting prototypes in new shapes and forms, thermal printers, spatial, full-body and flatbed scanners for work in 2D and 3D, a Bailey kiln for prototyping in ceramics and industrial design, digital HD video cameras, computer equipment, and an Apple Xserve server system for high speed rendering. . The Low Residency MAA program combines online and independent learning with annual summer intensives at our Vancouver campus, allowing you to study in your home community for the majority of the year.
