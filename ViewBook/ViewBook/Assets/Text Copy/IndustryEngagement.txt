Applied Research is central to the culture of Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Along with practice and the science of teaching, it forms a cornerstone of the University. Much of the research is grouped into themes; common interests that our groups of artists, researchers and students share. These include the Social and Interactive Media Centre (SIM Centre), the Stereoscopic 3D Centre (S3D Centre), and the Health Design Lab (HDL).  Research faculty and students work in collaboration with partners on projects that require creative solutions and practical outcomes - including commercial opportunities for our partners. These joint ventures ensure that the University continues to remain at the forefront of
innovative studio-based art, design, and media research.
