Emily Carr is actively engaged with the public through many different initiatives both on and off campus. Our collaborations within the larger community, industry, and other institutions throughout British Columbia underpin our academic framework and are woven into our innovative curriculum through the Faculty of Culture + Community. The Faculty supports an innovative cross-disciplinary curriculum. You are given the opportunity to interact and create relevant work that serves the community. 

Recent projects include collaborations with:  Elections BC – Designing For Democracy, Natural Capital with the David Suzuki Foundation, and the Vancouver Downtown Business Improvement Association WRAP project. 

In 2012/2013 over two hundred undergraduate and graduate students completed co-op/internship placements with employers in the fields of art, media and design. Third and fourth year students can apply to work in industry and earn credits towards their degree.
