Your undergraduate degree begins with a first-year foundation where you will have the opportunity to explore art, media and design through core academic and studio courses. 

You will be asked to develop fundamental visual and conceptual literacy, material and technical skills. and be encouraged to take risks and experiment with materials and ideas individually and collaboratively. This approach speaks to the interdisciplinary focus of the University and will help you in understanding and deciding the path you will take in choosing a major for your second year .
